how to integrate sbt with scala-eclipse-ide?

1. make a folder where u want to create scala project with the same "name" as "project name"
mkdir ScalaHdpcsd

2. go to that folder "ScalaHdpcsd" from cigwin and build the below 2 docs:

a. build.sbt
name:= "ScalaHdpcsd"   				//name same as project name, i.e folder name
version:= "0.13"					//dont take 1 as spark compatible with lower version
scalaVersion:= "2.10.6"				//dont take higher version

b. make the directory chain as usual:
src/main/scala

3. In the same folder, build sbt package:

sbt package			//will create empty .jar as no .scala file is present yet

4. In the same folder, make eclipse compatible:

sbt eclipse		//but will fail

how to make it work then to integrate with eclipse?

1. go to home of sbt, i.e
cd c:/user/sabyasachi/.sbt

2. verson 1.0 will be present by default, but create a version 0.13 as our build is of that version
mkdir 0.13

3. go to 0.13
cd 0.13

4. create plugins of not present
mkdir plugins

5. create plugins.sbt that will autodownload the plugins for eclipse integration
vi plugins.sbt
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "5.1.0")		//paster this inside the vi

6. go to the project folder and eclipse plugin dependencies will be autodownloaded now by the below comand:
sbt eclipse			//.classpth, .project, .settings will be added now for eclipse integration

how to add with eclipse now?
1. file--> import--> general-->existing project into workspace-->done

2. ignore src, src/main/scala is our main source path



summary:
scala requirements:
1. scala
2. JDK
3. scala eclipse IDE: to write applications
4. sbt: to compile usind command line

spark requirements:
1. spark
2. winutils.exe: to run spark

upto "..\bin" for every items, except "scala eclipse IDE" should be added to path
